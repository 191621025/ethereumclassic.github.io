# ethereumclassic.github.io

This was the first website created as fast as possible to attract the community's attention.
A new website is to come which will address most of the demands right now not yet fulfilled.

Immutability was preserved at Ethereum classic,
hackers are motivated to discover system vulnerabilities with deserved bounties.
The history of the public ledger cannot be rewritten.
Moral principles are not left aside for rescuing one or another company.

Thanks for your support!
Ethereum Classic development team.
