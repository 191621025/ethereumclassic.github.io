        <h2>Ideology</h2>

        <div class="declaration">

          <h3>The Ethereum Classic Declaration of Independence</h3>

          <p>Let it be known to the entire world that on July 20th, 2016, at block 1,920,000, we as a community of sovereign individuals stood united by a common vision to continue the original Ethereum blockchain that is truly free from censorship, fraud or third party interference. In realizing that the blockchain represents absolute truth, we stand by it, supporting its immutability and its future. We do not make this declaration lightly, nor without forethought to the consequences of our actions.</p>

          <h4>Looking Back</h4>

          <p>It should be stated with great gratitude that we acknowledge the creation of the Ethereum blockchain platform by the Ethereum Foundation and its founding developers. It certainly can be said without objection, that without their hard work and dedication that we as a community would not be where we are today.</p>

          <p>From its inception, the Ethereum blockchain was presented as a decentralized platform for “applications that run exactly as programmed without any chance of fraud, censorship, or third-party interference”<a href="https://ethereum.org/" target="_blank"><sup>1</sup></a>. It provided a place for the free association of ideas and applications from across the globe without fear of discrimination while also providing pseudonymity. In this decentralized platform, many of us saw great promise.</p>

          <h4>List of Grievances</h4>

          <p>It is however, with deep regret, that we as a community have had to spontaneously organize<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/EthereumClassic/comments/4u4o61/call_for_action_what_can_i_do_to_help_ethereum/" target="_blank"><sup>2</sup></a> to defend the Ethereum blockchain platform from its founding members and organization due to a long train of abuses, specifically by the leadership of the Ethereum Foundation. These grievances are as follows.</p>

          <ul>
            <li>For rushing the creation of a “soft fork,” which was comprised of a minor change in the Ethereum blockchain code for the sole purpose of creating a blacklist and censoring transactions that normally would have been allowed.</li>
            <li>For neglecting the full implications of the “soft fork” by the Ethereum blockchain as a warning that they were violating the principles and values coded therein.<a href="https://blog.ethereum.org/2016/06/28/security-alert-dos-vulnerability-in-the-soft-fork/" target="_blank"><sup>3</sup></a></li>
            <li>For creating an unrepresentative voting mechanism called the “carbon vote”, which they initially stated was “unofficial”<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/4s0rz6/a_vote_that_nobody_knows_about_is_not_a_vote/d55nye3" target="_blank"><sup>4</sup></a> only to contradict these statements a day before determining to hard fork.<a href=" https://blog.ethereum.org/2016/07/15/to-fork-or-not-to-fork/" target="_blank"><sup>5</sup></a></li>
            <li>For rushing the creation of a “hard fork,” which was comprised of an irregular state change in the Ethereum blockchain code that violated the properties of immutability, fungibility, and the sanctity of the ledger.</li>
            <li>For willfully deciding to not include replay protection in the “hard fork”, an action which has unnecessarily cost exchanges and thousands of users the rightful ownership of their Ether tokens.<a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CopwJVHXEAABEKd.jpg" target="_blank"><sup>6</sup></a></li>
          </ul>

          <h4>Respecting the Values Essential for Blockchains</h4>

          <p>One might ask what harm can be done from changing the code of the Ethereum blockchain and bailing out<a href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/bailout" target="_blank"><sup>7</sup></a> “The DAO” token holders, which is not an unreasonable question. Many of us have an innate sense of right and wrong, so at first glance rescuing "The DAO" felt right. However, it violated two key aspects of what gives peer-to-peer cash<a href="https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf" target="_blank"><sup>8</sup></a> and smart contract-based systems value: fungibility and immutability.</p>

          <p>Immutability means the blockchain is inviolable. That only valid transactions agreed upon via a cryptographic protocol determined by mathematics are accepted by the network. Without this, the validity of all transactions could come into question, since if the blockchain is mutable, any transaction could be modified. Not only does this leave transactions open to fraud, but it might spell disaster for any distributed application running atop the platform.</p>

          <p>Fungibility is the feature of money where one unit equals another unit. For instance, a Euro equals another Euro just as a Bitcoin equals another Bitcoin. Unfortunately, an ETH no longer equals another ETH. The alleged attacker’s ETH was no longer as good as your ETH and was worthy of censorship, deemed necessary by a so-called majority.</p>

          <p>Ultimately, these breaches in fungibility and immutability were made possible by the subjective morality judgements of those who felt a burning desire to bring the alleged attacker to justice. However, in doing so they compromised a core pillar of Ethereum just to do what they felt was in the interests of the “greater good”. In a global community where each individual has their own laws, customs, and beliefs, who is to say what is right and wrong?</p>

          <p>Deeply alarmed that these core tenets were disregarded by many of the Foundation’s developers, and a sizable portion of Ethereum participants, we, as a community, have organized and formed a code of principles to follow for the Ethereum Classic chain.</p>

          <h4>The Ethereum Classic Code of Principles</h4>

          <p>We believe in a decentralized, censorship-resistant, permission-less blockchain. We believe in the original vision of Ethereum as a world computer that cannot be shut down, running irreversible smart contracts. We believe in a strong separation of concerns, where system forks of the codebase are only possible when fixing protocol level vulnerabilities, bugs, or providing functionality upgrades. We believe in the original intent of building and maintaining a censorship-resistant, trustless and immutable development platform.</p>

          <p>Herein are written the declared values by which participants within the Ethereum Classic community agree. We encourage that these principles not be changed via edict by any individual or faction claiming to wield power, authority or credibility to do so.</p>

          <p>We, as a community agree that:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>The purpose of Ethereum Classic is to provide a decentralized platform that runs decentralized applications which execute exactly as programmed without any possibility of downtime, censorship, fraud or third party interference.</li>
            <li>Code is law; there shall be no changes to the Ethereum Classic code that violate the properties of immutability, fungibility, or sanctity of the ledger; transactions or ledger history cannot for any reason be reversed or modified.</li>
            <li>Forks and/or changes to the underlying protocol shall only be permitted for updating or upgrading the technology on which Ethereum Classic operates.</li>
            <li>Internal project development can be funded by anyone, whether via a trusted third party of their choice or directly, using the currency of their choice on a per project basis and following a transparent, open and decentralized crowdfunding protocol.</li>
            <li>Any individual or group of individuals may propose improvements, enhancements, or upgrades to existing or proposed Ethereum Classic assets.</li>
            <li>Any individual or group of individuals may use the Ethereum Classic decentralized platform to build decentralized applications, hold crowdsales, create autonomous organisations/corporations, or for any other purpose they deem suitable.</li>
          </ul>

          <h4>Looking Forward</h4>

          <p>For the many reasons listed above, we have chosen to rename the original blockchain “Ethereum Classic” with the ticker symbol “ETC”, so that the community and all other participants can identify the original, unforked, and immutable blockchain platform.</p>

          <p>Our most sincere gratitude goes to those developers within and outside the Foundation who opposed interfering with the Ethereum blockchain ledger and enabled the Ethereum Classic chain to survive and live on. We know there are many of you and we welcome you at anytime to join our decentralized community.</p>

          <p>We will continue the vision of decentralized governance for the Ethereum Classic blockchain and maintain our opposition to any centralized leadership takeover, especially by the Ethereum Foundation as well as the developers who have repeatedly stated that they would no longer develop the Ethereum Classic chain.</p>

          <p>We likewise will openly resist the “tyranny of the majority,” and will not allow the values of the system to be compromised. As a united community, we will continue to organize for the defense and advancement, as required, for the continuation and assurance of this grand experiment. The Ethereum Classic platform, its code and technology, are now open to the world as Open Source software.<a href="https://github.com/ethereumproject" target="_blank"><sup>9</sup></a> It is now freely available for all who wish to improve and build upon it: a truly free and trustless world computer that we together as a community have proven and will continue to prove is anti-fragile.<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13530973-antifragile" target="_blank"><sup>10</sup></a></p>

        <h2>Goals</h2>

        <p>The main goal of the project is to ensure survival of the original Ethereum blockchain. We will strive to provide alternative for people who strongly disagree with DAO bailout and the direction Ethereum Foundation is taking their project. Anyone opting to remain on the original chain should have such opportunity.</p>

        <h2>Plan</h2>

        <h3>Development</h3>

        <p>We fork Ethereum and maintain upstream patches similar to the relation between Redhat and CentOS, until a community can form around the project and create a road map. Until this happens we can fork multiple existing clients to help prevent a monoculture of clients. We plan to follow <a href="http://github.com/ethereum">http://github.com/ethereum</a> development except for any features they introduce into existing clients that violate the key principles of openness, neutrality and immutability.</p>

        <h2>What can I do?</h2>

        <p>Please help us spread the word about this project in Ethereum community! </p>

        <h3>Volunteers</h3>

        <p>If you feel strongly about the cause, please get involved. We need your support to ensure original Ethereum will be kept alive. We need more developers, website designers, people who can write and advocate the need for Ethereum Classic. Please let us know what are your skills and how you would like to contribute, <a href="https://github.com/ethereumproject/Volunteer">reply here</a>. Redditors, please <a href="http://np.reddit.com/r/EthereumClassic/comments/4sxupj/making_sure_original_ethereum_survives_please_get/">reply here</a>. Github users, please <a href="http://github.com/ethereumclassic/README/issues/new">open new issue</a>.</p>

        <h3>Users</h3>

        <p>In order to remain on the original Ethereum chain, just don't upgrade to hardfork client version pushed by Ethereum Foundation. We will maintain non-fork versions of all major Ethereum clients (as well as other key software), so going forwards all the improvements will be available to you.</p>

        <p>Fun fact. Everyone who had legacy ETH in your wallet pre-fork, now has an extra 'bonus': you have the same amount of classic ethers (ETC) on the same address. If you install Ethereum Classic client (better on a separate computer), you can use your coins on both chains! Just follow this advice to <a href="https://github.com/ethereumclassic/README/issues/3">separate your legacy funds cleanly and avoid replay attack</a>. If you held ETH balances with major exchanges: Bitfinex, Poloniex, Kraken, you have good news: they are going to assign you an equal amount ETC post-fork!</p>

        <h3>Miners</h3>

        <p>Miners supporting the original chain should just keep mining with current version of software for now, without upgrading to client version introducing the hardfork code. It will be always possible to download and build latest non-fork version from <a href="http://github.com/ethereumclassic">http://github.com/ethereumclassic</a>.</p>

        <p>The difficulty bump after the fork was huge, but overall the separation of the networks went smoothly. Our miners stood strong and prevailed against long odds. We are past the initial difficulty bump, nethash is about 30GH, making Ethereum Classic one of the most secure blockchains (for comparison, original Ethereum started with just 16GH last August). Time between blocks is back to normal, network stable and ready for business. Mining is becoming sustainable, even solo miners have a chance to make a classic block or two. It is now possible to obtain decent mining rewards in classic ethers from mining. Join in on the fun!</p>

        <h3>Traders</h3>

        <p>Most important question for traders is 'will ETC have market price'? There are all reasons to believe that it will. Essentially, ETC is an Ethereum <a href="http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=563972.0">'spinoff coin'</a> with a wide user base of all current ETH users. Some of them will see the value of transacting on a censorship-resistant chain, some won't. This creates interesting arbitrage opportunities for smart traders. Additional reasoning why <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/4sxwo3/ethereum_classic_keep_original/d5dawgg">ETC is very unlikely to be 'worthless'</a>.</p>

        <p>All the major exchanges announced that they will assign their users both ETH and ETC after the fork. This is a step in the right direction, now it's up to these major exchanges to enable ETH/ETC trading that will no doubt be demanded by users. Decentralized exchange Bitsquare started <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/EthereumClassic/comments/4t30qf/bitsquare_will_add_ethc_trading_immediately/">ETC trading right after the fork</a>. Other trading venues will follow since there is a strong business case. We are in touch with several other exchanges to add ETC trading to their platforms. If your exchange is interested in ETC trading, please <a href="mailto:bitnovosti@gmail.com">contact us</a>.</p>
