## Decentralized Governance

We believe there are many problems with centralization and opaqueness; corruption, unaccountability, nepotism, inefficiency and social bias. Ultimately, centralization leads to fragility.

These problems can be solved by adhering to governance systems that do not rely on a central point of failure. Just like distributed networks and the consensus protocol itself, we believe that only truly decentralized projects will survive in the long run.

Ethereum Classic manifests these values by relinquishing control from a formalized central foundation. The only hierarchy is that of transparent meritocracy and mutual reputation. No backroom deals or behind-closed-doors unilateral decision making; just free and open discourse.
