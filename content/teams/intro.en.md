# Teams

The Ethereum Classic Community is decentralized and doesn't have a formal hierarchy; it's a permissionless 'do-ocracy', where anyone can participate. Individuals and teams choose tasks for themselves and execute them.

This page contains a selection of the prominent teams who are actively contributing to the ETC ecosystem.

ETC is growing and now is a great time to get involved in an important and unique blockchain project! If you'd like to contribute, a good place to start is to reach out to one of the below. You can also join our [discord channel](https://discordapp.com/invite/HW4GckH).
