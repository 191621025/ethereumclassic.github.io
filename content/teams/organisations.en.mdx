## Organizations

There are a number of teams who contribute to Ethereum Classic.

<LinkSection title="ETC Labs" to="https://etclabs.org/">

ETC Labs provides funding, industry connections, and office space to burgeoning ETC projects; with office space in San Francisco and Singapore. Their long-term goal is to accelerate the development of the Ethereum Classic community & ecosystem.

The ETC Labs Core team will be focused on core Ethereum Classic projects, supporting the ETC blockchain, providing tooling for decentralized application development, mining, and services. In pursuit of our mission, we value state immutability, decentralization, and backward compatibility.

<LinkSection title="ETC Core" to="https://etccore.io/">

ETC Core is the leading Ethereum Classic core development team.

From fundamental specifications, tooling suites, and resources, we deliver open-source tooling for the Ethereum Classic ecosystem. We strongly believe in cross-chain compatability and implement that philosophy in our projects. You can use many of our tools on any EVM-based blockchain.

We actively support the long term development of the ETC protocol. We do this by championing improvement specifications to adoption and maintaining Multi-Geth.

We are commited to maximizing the capabilities of the EthereumStack through our EVM-LLVM project and compiler improvement initiatives.

<LinkSection title="ETC Cooperative" to="https://www.etccooperative.org/">

The ETC Cooperative (the “ECC”) was created to financially support the growth and development of Ethereum Classic by funding three key aspects of the ETC ecosystem: development, marketing, and community. To that end they serve as a liason between various teams, maintain community-based software, and reach out to members of other Ethereum-based communities.

<LinkSection title="IOHK (Grothendieck)" to="https://iohk.io/projects/ethereum-classic/">

Named after a leading figure in the creation of modern algebraic geometry, the IOHK Grothendieck Team is a motivated group of math and science-driven engineers and developers. At the forefront of team’s development is Mantis, a node client built from scratch using Scala, a functional programming language. Mantis easily connects to the IOHK Daedalus Wallet UI, allowing users to easily manage their ETC. The team’s focus is to securely and methodically establish a strong ETC ecosystem, with a solid foundation and immutability at its core.
