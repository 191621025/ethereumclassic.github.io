<LinkSection title="Etc Cooperative" to="https://www.etccooperative.org/">

The ETC Cooperative (the “ECC”) was created to financially support the growth and development of Ethereum Classic by funding three key aspects of the ETC ecosystem: development, marketing, and community. To that end they serve as a liason between various teams, maintain community-based software, and reach out to members of other Ethereum-based communities.
