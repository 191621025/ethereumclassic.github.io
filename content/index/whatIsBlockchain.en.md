Put simply, Ethereum Classic provides a way to manage digital assets without the need for intermediaries, such as banks and other financial institutions.

ETC allows uncensorable smart contracts to be written, deployed and executed; it enables truly unstoppable programmable money.

Ethereum Classic is the continuation of the *original* non-forked Ethereum (ETH) chain and exists to preserve the principle of "code is law".

To find out more about ETC's history and where it's going, check out the [Ethereum Classic roadmap](/roadmap).
