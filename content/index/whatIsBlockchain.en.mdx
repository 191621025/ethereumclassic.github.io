### What is a Blockchain?

Put simply, blockchains provide a way to keep track of digital assets (money, things) without the need for intermediaries, such as banks and other financial institutions.

### More than just a Blockchain

If the Internet was simply a bunch of interconnected computers, and didn’t have any users or creators making websites, it would be largely useless. In much the same way a blockchain needs users and creators. ETC has both and we’re working on solving real world problems of interconnecting people and their devices.
