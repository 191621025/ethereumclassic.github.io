## Roadmap

### Etc Developer Plans for 2019-2020

Ethereum Classic (ETC) is a blockchain and Cryptocurrency that takes digitized value further. Rather than just allowing people to send value to each other ETC allows them to create more complex contracts between each other that operate autonomously.

Our goal is to make ETC ubiquitous across the world with developers integrating our blockchain wherever they need. This will ultimately allow users to effortlessly experience blockchainâ€™s benefits.
